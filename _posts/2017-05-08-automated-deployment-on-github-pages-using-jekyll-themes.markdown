### GUI to write and edit posts [www.cyobb.com](http://www.cyobb.com).
 I always wanted a GUI to write and edit posts with the power of github pages and flexibility of jekyll themes.                  
So, i have created one, which automates deployment and provides a number of options right at one place all GUI.             
Here you can choose jekyll theme, update basic blog details( title,description,cover image,author image,author name...), add custom url, edit and add posts, add tracking id, about page.            
Check it out [here](http://www.cyobb.com).
